#Accessibility

__by Laura Brady__

_Notes by Chris Wait_


##Who needs accessible content?

* Between disabled users and users with a _situational disability_, 100% of potential users will at some point need to take advantage of accessibility features

* Accessibility features are _enhancements_ that can benefit everyone

* Currently there is an _accesible digital famine_

##In the EPUB

* Use <em>, <i>, <strong>, <b>
  *<em> and <i> are semantically different. <em> denotes emphasis (text that a character is shouting), <i> denotes italic style text (which may not be meaningful in spoken text, i.e., the convention of italicizing foreign text, which will be apparent in the accent of the speaking voice). Same for bold.


* Use semantic tags throughout
  * <body>
  * <section>
  * <h1>, <h2>, etc.
  * <p>
  * <figure>
  * <figcaption>
  * <aside>

* Use landmarks

* Test in night mode

* Avoid tabular format (use lists instead)

* For decorative images, use empty alt tags

* __Test in _night mode___

* Use pages (_rorohiko_ script)
