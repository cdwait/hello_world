#Who I Am

*I* am an ebook developer who wants to learn **how to _use_ markdown**

#What want to use it for

I want to use _markdown_ for the following purposes

1. To experiment with XML-first workflow
  * This could increase efficiency at ND
2. To just be kind of a badass overall
  * This is the whole point of everything
